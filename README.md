# sa-hunter 
Correlates serviceaccounts and pods to the permissions granted to them via rolebindings and clusterrolesbindings.

For clusters hosted on managed Kubernetes services, `sa-hunter` identifies serviceaccount annotations that assign cloud provider IAM entities to Kubernetes serviceaccounts. Currently `sa-hunter` supports serviceaccount annotations on EKS and GKE.


## Quick Start
`python3` and `pip3` are required, can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads]).
1. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/twistlock/sa-hunter
```
2. Install  the required python packages.
```bash
pip3 install -r sa-hunter/requirements.txt
```
3. Connect `kubectl` to your cluster.
4. Run `sa-hunter`.
```bash
cd sa-hunter
./sa_hunter.py
```

## Help

```
usage: sa_hunter.py [-h] [-a] [-o OUT_FILE] [-l]

Correlates serviceaccounts and pods to the permissions granted to them via rolebindings and clusterrolesbindings.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -a           show all service accounts, not only those assigned to a pod
  -o OUT_FILE  save results to output file
  -l           loud mode, print results regardless of -o
```
